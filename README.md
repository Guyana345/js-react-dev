# Starter-Kit
Note: this project i built it while learning at the same time, the way i structure files 

So I built this for quick start for anyone to use... My Goal is to save you time from the installation, configuration and spending time going through setup and testing before you start coding or maybe your just learning to code. Sometimes all we just want to do is just start coding right away.
